#  ================ AlphaZero algorithm for Connect 4 game =================== #
# Name:             elorating.py
# Description:      This allows to directly compute winrate and elorating of a given best_model against given MCTS sim_number
#                   Almost identical/taken from https://pytorch.org/docs/0.4.0/_modules/torchvision/models/resnet.html
